			<h3>Is there a superannuation payment for accrued long service leave and annual leave?</h3>
			<p class="lead">If long service leave or annual leave is paid out upon termination of employment, superannuation contributions are not required to be made. Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Your-workers/Work-out-tax-to-withhold-and-super-to-pay/#Paidleave">Work out tax to withhold and super to pay</a> on ATO website.</p>

			<h3>Is the notice of redundancy for an employee aged younger than 65 tax free?</h3>
			<p class="lead">If you mean the Employment Termination Payments (ETP) tax rate for people above the Preservation age (60 or older), it should be 17%. For people under preservation age (60), it should be 32.00%. However if the payment is a genuine redundancy payment and lower than the ETP tax-free limit, it will be tax free. Please read more about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Schedule-11---Tax-table-for-employment-termination-payments/?page=2">ETP caps</a> on ATO website.</p>
			
			<h3>I am 67 and have just been made redundant. I was told that because I'm over the pension age it's classed as a non-genuine redundancy so I do not get a tax-free amount. Have I been mis-informed ?</h3>
			<p class="lead">According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=TXR/TR20092/NAT/ATO/00001">Taxation Ruling: TR 2009/2</a> on ATO website, an employee must be less than the pension age at the time of dismissal for a redundancy payment to qualify as a genuine redundancy payment. However, if the employment of a particular employee would have otherwise terminated at a younger age than the pension age, the employee must be dismissed before that time.</p>
			<p class="lead">Based on the above-mentioned you are not mis-informed. Since you was made redundant at an age older than the pension age, your redundancy payment cannot be qualified as a genuine redundancy payment so you cannot have the Employment Termination Payments (ETP) tax-free limit.</p>
			<p class="lead">The table below shows the pension age.</p>

			<h3>What is a genuine redundancy payment?</h3>
			<p class="lead">A genuine redundancy payment is one "received by an employee who is dismissed from employment because the employee's position is genuinely redundant". There are four necessary components within this requirement:</p>
			<p class="lead">
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Component 1</span> The payment being tested must be received in consequence of an employee's termination.<br>
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Component 2</span> That termination must involve the employee being dismissed from employment.<br>
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Component 3</span> That dismissal must be caused by the redundancy of the employee's position.<br>
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Component 4</span> The redundancy payment must be made genuinely because of a redundancy.</p>
			<p class="lead">The satisfaction of this requirement establishes the essential character of the payment. However, there are further conditions (list below) that must also be satisfied before a payment can be treated as a genuine redundancy payment.</p>
			<p class="lead">
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Condition 1</span> The dismissed employee is not older than specified age limits;<br>
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Condition 2</span> The termination is not at the end of a fixed period of employment;<br>
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Condition 3</span> The actual amount paid is not greater than the amount that could reasonably be expected had the parties been dealing at arm's length, in the event that the employer and employee are in fact not dealing at arm's length in relation to the dismissal;<br>
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Condition 4</span> There is no arrangement entered into between the employer and the employee or the employer and another entity to employ the dismissed employee after the termination; and<br>
			<span class="badge badge-primary badge-pill" style="font-size: 0.88em;">Condition 5</span> The payment is not in lieu of superannuation benefits.</p>
			<p class="lead">Please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=TXR/TR20092/NAT/ATO/00001">Taxation Ruling: TR 2009/2</a> on ATO website.</p>
			
			<h3>What amount of notice of termination must be given?</h3>
			<p class="lead">Based on the National Employment Standards (NES), the minimum notice period is listed in the table below. This applies to all employees (other than casuals), not just those covered by the national workplace relations system.</p>
			<table class="table table-hover table-striped table-bordered" title="NES Minimum Notice Period">

			<p class="lead">* Employees whose position is made redundant after 10 years or more of service will receive only 12 weeks' pay, to avoid 'double counting' for employees who receive pro rata long service leave entitlements. This is consistent with the <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUConstrLawNlr/2004/42.pdf">2004 Redundancy Case</a> decision made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</p>
